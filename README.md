Overview
This project demonstrates a wireless communication system using NRF24L01 modules. The system consists of three nodes:

NODE A: Connected to an Arduino, identified as BASE01.

NODE B: Connected to an Arduino, identified as BASE02.

NODE C: Connected to an ESP, identified as BASE03.

Each node can transmit and receive data, and the system uses a broadcast mechanism where each node broadcasts its data, and the destination address is extracted to determine the recipient.

Features
Dynamic Addressing: Each node broadcasts its data with a destination address, allowing the system to dynamically route messages.

Data Integrity: Uses checksums or CRC to ensure data integrity during transmission.

Acknowledgment (ACK): Implements an ACK mechanism to confirm successful data reception.

Error Handling: Includes retry logic for failed transmissions and error correction for minor data errors.

Power Management: Implements sleep modes to conserve power when nodes are idle.

Security: Includes basic encryption and authentication to secure data transmission.

Scalability: Designed to be modular, allowing easy addition of new nodes.

Remote Monitoring: Utilizes the ESP's Wi-Fi capabilities for remote monitoring and control.

Hardware Requirements
NRF24L01 Modules: 3 units

Arduino Boards: 2 units (for NODE A and NODE B)

ESP Board: 1 unit (for NODE C)

Power Supply: 3.3V for NRF modules

Antennas: Optional, for improved range

Capacitors: 10uF and 0.1uF for stabilizing power to NRF modules

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE

ESP Development Environment (e.g., Arduino IDE with ESP32/ESP8266 support)

RF24 Library: For Arduino and ESP

Encryption Libraries: Optional, for data encryption

Setup Instructions
1. Hardware Connections
Connect the NRF24L01 modules to the Arduino and ESP boards as follows:

VCC to 3.3V

GND to GND

CE to a digital pin as 9
CSN to a digital pin (e.g., D8)

SCK to SCK

MOSI to MOSI

MISO to MISO

Ensure that the power supply to the NRF modules is stable by adding capacitors if necessary.

2. Software Configuration
Install the RF24 library in the Arduino IDE.

Configure the addresses for each node:

NODE A: BASE01

NODE B: BASE02

NODE C: BASE03

Upload the appropriate code to each node:

NODE A: nodeA.ino

NODE B: nodeB.ino

NODE C: nodeC.ino

3. Running the System
Power up all nodes.

Each node will start broadcasting its data.

The destination address in the broadcasted data will be extracted, and the data will be routed accordingly.
